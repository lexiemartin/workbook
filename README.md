# Lexie Martin's Workbook

Coding is, in my experience, one of those skills that gets rusty very quickly if you don't practice. So here I am practicing. This repository is full of simple exercises to help me remember syntax and be a better coder.

This repository is also full of cat jokes. I like cats. I like jokes. Making cat jokes makes the whole problem-solving process a lot more fun for me.
